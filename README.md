# Data Cleaning Project using SQL
In this project, I worked with Nashville Housing Data, a dataset containing statistics about land use and properties in Nashville.  I used SQL in Microsoft SQL Management Server Studio to clean the data from this database.

## Data Collection
The dataset was gotten from [Nashville Housing Data](https://github.com/Mercy-Mallel/Data-Cleaning-Project-using-SQL/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data.xlsx)

## Metadata
The dataset is composed of 20 columns and 56,477 rows.
+ UniqueID — id number attributed to each row.
+ ParcelID — code attributed to a land.
+ LandUse — shows the different uses of land.
+ SalesPrice — cost of land
+ LegalReference — citation is the practice of crediting and referring to authoritative documents and sources.
+ OwnerName_ name of land owner
+ Acreage — the size of an area of land in acres
+ LandValue — the worth of the land
+ Building Value — worth of a building
+ Total Value — landvalue + building value
+ YearBuilt — year the building was built
+ FullBath — a bathroom that includes a shower, a bathtub, a sink, and a toilet.
+ HalfBath — a half bathroom only contains a sink and a toilet
+ Sale_Date — date when the land was sold
+ SaleAddress — address of land sold
+ City — location of land
+ Owner_Address — owners house address
+ OwnerCity — city where owner lives
+ OwnerState — state where owner is located

## Importing Data
I created a database called Nashville Housing Data, then imported the table which I named Nashville Housing in Microsoft SQL Management Server Studio.
